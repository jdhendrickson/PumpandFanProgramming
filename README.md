# PumpandFanProgramming
This is a project for my SER 416 class. We were supposed to come up with a project entirely on our own and then actually create the project. We were provided an atmega 128p, a breadboard, and a very basic wire and parts kit to use. For my project, I also used a 3D printer from the school's fabrication lab to create some parts of the project.
My project was a fan and mister combo I wanted to have installed on the back porch.
As the project is chosen by the student, and is entirely individual I think it's safe enough for me to make the code public.
